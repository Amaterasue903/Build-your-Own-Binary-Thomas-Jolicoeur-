Kathleen M:

Was documentation clear? Yes! I know how to consult the binary code to create something from it. Interface changes; I think it works just fine! I liked having a good range of shapes and colors to use, and I liked that the position was fixed on a circular surface. I could see it being a fun exercise to try to get as much variety as possible when filling out each spot. Itâ€™s like a digital charm bracelet. Difficulty: very little. The display and example were clear and instructive.
